## Introduction
OpenAI provides cutting-edge AI models and tools for developers to integrate and enhance their applications with AI
capabilities. This document serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding and utilizing the OpenAI API efficiently.

## API Overview
Detailed overview of API endpoints, authentication methods, and request/response formats used in OpenAI's services.

## Event Descriptions
The events emitted by OpenAI's systems are as follows:

### Thread Events
- **thread.created**: Occurs when a new thread is created.

### Run Events
- **thread.run.created**: Occurs when a new run is created.
- **thread.run.queued**: Occurs when a run moves to a queued status.
- **thread.run.in_progress**: Occurs when a run moves to an in_progress status.
- **thread.run.requires_action**: Occurs when a run moves to a requires_action status.
- **thread.run.completed**: Occurs when a run is completed.
- **thread.run.failed**: Occurs when a run fails.
- **thread.run.cancelling**: Occurs when a run moves to a cancelling status.
- **thread.run.cancelled**: Occurs when a run is cancelled.
- **thread.run.expired**: Occurs when a run expires.

### Step Events
- **thread.run.step.created**: Occurs when a run step is created.
- **thread.run.step.in_progress**: Occurs when a run step moves to an in_progress state.
- **thread.run.step.delta**: Occurs when parts of a run step are being streamed.
- **thread.run.step.completed**: Occurs when a run step is completed.
- **thread.run.step.failed**: Occurs when a run step fails.
- **thread.run.step.cancelled**: Occurs when a run step is cancelled.
- **thread.run.step.expired**: Occurs when a run step expires.

### Message Events
- **thread.message.created**: Occurs when a message is created.
- **thread.message.in_progress**: Occurs when a message moves to an in_progress state.
- **thread.message.delta**: Occurs when parts of a Message are being streamed.
- **thread.message.completed**: Occurs when a message is completed.
- **thread.message.incomplete**: Occurs when a message ends before it is completed.

### Error Events
- **error**: Occurs when an error occurs. This can happen due to an internal server error or a timeout.
- **done**: Occurs when a stream ends.

## Best Practices
- **Batch Requests**: Limit the number of HTTP calls by batching your requests.
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling and retry mechanisms.
- **Monitor Usage**: Set up alerts to monitor your usage and stay within quota limits.

## Error Handling
- **Common Errors**: Understand and handle common errors, such as timeouts and server errors.
- **Error Codes**: Familiarize yourself with the error codes and their meanings to debug effectively.
