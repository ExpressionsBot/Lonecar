## Getting Started

  

Follow these instructions to set up and run the AI-powered chat application on your local machine.

  

### Prerequisites

  

- **Node.js** (version 18.0.0 or higher)

- **npm** (comes with Node.js)

- **Supabase** account and project

- **OpenAI** API key

- **Pinecone** account and API key

  

### Installation

  

1. **Clone the Repository**

  

   ```bash

   git clone <repository_url>

   cd <repository_folder>

   ```

  

2. **Install Dependencies**

  

   ```bash

   npm install

   ```

  

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**

  

   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:

  

   ```bash

   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url

   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key

   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

   PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_api_key

   PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT=your_pinecone_environment

   PINECONE_INDEX_NAME=your_pinecone_index_name

   ```

  

   Replace `your_*` with your actual keys and URLs.

  

4. **Configure Supabase**

  

   - Create the following tables in your Supabase project:

  

     - `users`

     - `chat_sessions`

     - `conversations`

  

   - Set up the appropriate authentication and access policies.

  

5. **Initialize Pinecone**

  

   - Set up a Pinecone index with the name specified in `PINECONE_INDEX_NAME`.

  

6. **Run the Development Server**

  

   ```bash

   npm run dev

   ```

  

   The application should now be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

  

### Additional Notes

  

- Ensure that all API keys and sensitive information are kept secure and not committed to version control.

- Refer to the project documentation for details on database schema and environment configurations.
