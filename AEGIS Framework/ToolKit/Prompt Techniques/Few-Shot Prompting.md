# Few-Shot Prompting: A Detailed Ontology

## Overview
Few-shot prompting is a technique used to improve the performance of large language models (LLMs) on tasks where zero-shot prompting might not be sufficient. It leverages **in-context learning** by providing the model with several demonstrations of the task within the prompt, allowing the model to generalize and produce better outputs based on the given examples.

According to **Touvron et al. (2023)**, the properties of few-shot learning began to emerge when models were scaled to a sufficient size. This idea was first explored in-depth by **Kaplan et al. (2020)**.

## The Concept
In few-shot prompting, we condition the model by feeding it a set of **input-output pairs** (also called exemplars or demonstrations) before asking it to generate the desired output for a new example. This enables the model to learn patterns, conditioning it to apply similar reasoning or logic to subsequent prompts.

Few-shot prompting can be applied to a wide range of tasks, from simple sentence completions to more complex reasoning and problem-solving tasks.

## Example of Few-Shot Prompting

Let's explore an example from **Brown et al. (2020)**, which shows how the model learns to use a new word in context after seeing a single example (1-shot prompting):

### Prompt:
```text
A "whatpu" is a small, furry animal native to Tanzania. An example of a sentence that uses the word "whatpu" is:
We were traveling in Africa and we saw these very cute whatpus.
To do a "farduddle" means to jump up and down really fast. An example of a sentence that uses the word "farduddle" is:
```

### Model Output:
```text
When we won the game, we all started to farduddle in celebration.
```

Here, the model has successfully learned the meaning of the word **"farduddle"** after being shown just one example. By increasing the number of demonstrations (e.g., 3-shot, 5-shot, etc.), the model’s performance can improve even further for more challenging tasks.

## Key Properties of Few-Shot Prompting
As noted by **Min et al. (2022)**, several factors influence the success of few-shot prompting:
- **Label Space**: The labels used in the demonstrations are critical, even if they are not always correct.
- **Format**: The structure of the prompt significantly affects performance. Consistent formatting helps maintain coherence.
- **Distribution**: Selecting labels from a true distribution (instead of a uniform random one) leads to better outcomes.

### Experimenting with Random Labels
Even when using random labels, the model can sometimes generate correct predictions:

```text
This is awesome! // Negative
This is bad! // Positive
Wow, that movie was rad! // Positive
What a horrible show! // Negative
```

The model often correctly predicts the sentiment of these sentences despite the label assignments being arbitrary. This demonstrates the model’s robustness, particularly in more recent iterations of GPT models.

## Limitations of Few-Shot Prompting
While few-shot prompting works effectively for many tasks, it has limitations, particularly when applied to tasks involving complex reasoning.

### Reasoning Example:
Consider the following task:
```text
The odd numbers in this group add up to an even number: 15, 32, 5, 13, 82, 7, 1.
```

### Model Output:
```text
Yes, the odd numbers in this group add up to 107, which is an even number.
```

Clearly, the model gives an incorrect response here. While it correctly sums the odd numbers, it fails to understand that **107 is odd**, not even. This highlights the limitations of few-shot prompting for complex reasoning tasks.

## Attempting to Improve with More Examples
To see if adding more demonstrations helps:

### Prompt:
```text
The odd numbers in this group add up to an even number: 4, 8, 9, 15, 12, 2, 1.
A: The answer is False.

The odd numbers in this group add up to an even number: 17, 10, 19, 4, 8, 12, 24.
A: The answer is True.

The odd numbers in this group add up to an even number: 16, 11, 14, 4, 8, 13, 24.
A: The answer is False.

The odd numbers in this group add up to an even number: 17, 9, 10, 12, 13, 4, 2.
A: The answer is True.
```

Even after adding more examples, the model still struggles with reliably solving the reasoning task. Few-shot prompting is insufficient in these cases because the task requires more structured reasoning or logical breakdown.

## Alternatives: Chain-of-Thought Prompting
In response to the shortcomings of few-shot prompting for complex tasks, **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting** has gained popularity. CoT prompting breaks down the task into a series of reasoning steps, helping the model perform better on symbolic, arithmetic, or commonsense reasoning tasks.

---

## Conclusion
Few-shot prompting is an effective technique for certain tasks, particularly when zero-shot prompting is insufficient. However, it has its limitations in complex reasoning scenarios. In such cases, it may be necessary to:
- **Experiment with other prompting techniques** like Chain-of-Thought prompting.
- **Fine-tune the model** for better task-specific performance.
- **Add more context or examples** to better guide the model's outputs.

Few-shot prompting is just one step towards mastering the broader art of prompt engineering and LLM performance optimization.
